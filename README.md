Hello, 

I'll try to track my progress going through the Odin Project. Today is 1/12/2021 and I plan on having a job as a software engineer at the end of this year or hopefully by summer through studying dilligently every day and having a portfolio to show my skill. 

*I have not rewritten responsive web design notes, these are just from freecodecamp's curriculum, I'm just putting them in a file for future reference for myself, and to keep track of my progress overall of The Odin Project.

Goals: Finish some css I need to get this done by this week, CSS just seems so mind numbing to me, I'm about to skip and go to object oriented programming.
